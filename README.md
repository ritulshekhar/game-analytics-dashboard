## 📈 Visualizations & KPIs

| Section | Visualization / Metric |
|--------|------------------------|
| **KPI Summary** | Total Revenue, Paying Users, ARPPU |
| **Engagement Trend** | DAU (Daily Active Users) line chart |
| **Retention** | Cohort Retention Heatmap (0–12 months since signup) |
| **Progression** | Level Completion Funnel (all levels) |
| **Playtime Behavior** | Average Session Time by Country & Platform |

---

## 🔎 Key Insights (from Synthetic Data)

- Consistent DAU through the year → stable active user base  
- Retention declines after 3–4 months → focus on mid-lifecycle re-engagement  
- Noticeable drop-off at higher levels → potential difficulty spike / retention leak  
- Playtime highest from Mobile users in major markets — informs device-first strategy  
- Paying users generate the majority of revenue, ARPPU indicates strong monetization potential  

With real data, this framework helps identify where to optimize game design, user acquisition, and monetization.
